# On the contents of this repository
This repository contains all the materials and code necessary to run the behavioral experiments reported in the Psychological Science article "Does neuronal recycling result in destructive competition? The influence of learning to read on the recognition of faces."

If you want to run these experiments yourself, you can download or clone this repository and run `test_suite.py` to present the full test battery in the order used in the _Psychological Science_ article (or run any of the other `.py` files to present each task individually). You will need to have recent versions of Python 3 and PsychoPy installed in order to run the experiment suite.
